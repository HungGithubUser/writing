[Invest as an engineer]

This is a draft of what I will say at the lightning talk for East Agile on Monday 5 April 2025.

When I was in my teenage years, my older sister once told me that money will lose its value over time. That's the way the Government pushes people to work to avoid stagnation, and something something. My sister was studying Finance at University and that's what she learned, she was not a very good teacher, so I canâ€™t remember much of what she tried to teach my teenage self. That was the origin of my awareness about "investing".

Fast forward to 2020, when I made my first money via internship. I noticed "investing" once again, in the form: "my hard earned money will lose its value over time, so what should I exchange my money to to avoid this problem". The trend back then was crypto and stock (this was before the Covid, and at the peak of the Crypto hype). So I went for both, with the little money I had, some on BNB, some on Index and Mutual funds.

I was a senior student at the time, a novice in investing, but not learning. When I hear people say you have to "learn" to invest, I put my learning hats on. I read books and watched Youtube videos, people were idealizing Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham at the time. So I read about "Value investing principles" from these 2. I understood the essence, I tried to practice some examples, but I did not share the feeling. The practices felt so useless and foreign to an engineer. Besides, the overarching theme was "You will mostly not beat the market index, so you better off not putting in too much work and just trust the index anyway". What the 2 investors did was to read financial reports, practice statistical analysis and emotional control; then put a price on the companies/assets, and buy the ones that are undervalued to later sell at a higher price.

Then I came across the legendary startup investors Sam Altman (then later Paul Graham, Ron Conway, Peter Thiel) with a much different way of determining the future. The idea is: Engineers are supposed to be believers and makers of the future. You should be confident and absolute about the future. You can be wrong in the details, so it's important to be confident and flexible, but you have to have strong belief regardless of how bad the situation currently is. Because you can, and should, create the future.

What does that have to do with engineering investing you may ask? Two things:
- Investing is predicting the future, and engineers should predict the future in a definite fashion with reasoning, not estimating with statistical analysis.
- Investing requires bravery to go against the crowd to put your money in your high conviction bets for a very long time. And engineers, more than any other profession, should be the bravest of all.

You should learn about price hype cycle, everything chart of price in an open market will follow some sine wave. We are living in a time of abundance of information and intelligence, but very lack of bravery; so it is very easy to detect when something is overly priced (it is harder to detect when something is underpriced, I will explain this later). When the press are mentioning so much about something, and people around you are also mentioning that; you know they are overpriced. An example is the 2 hype cycles of Crypto price in March 2021 and January 2025, where if you remember, people were all over the place talking about Crypto, and the press was very excited, conveniently right before its significant drop in 2023.

The inverse of this phenomenon is when things are underpriced you might say? Well... yes and no. It is true that when nobody is talking about something, that thing is likely to be underpriced. But the catch is only if it has real value, otherwise it is a fraud. This is where you have to be brave, to detect things that are underpriced, you don't need much intelligence. For example, are you brave enough to believe in Viet Nam future prospects right now given Trump's tariff act? If you do, which company or stock are you brave enough to put money in? Is this a blind act of stubbornness or true bravery? You can't prove your bets are right until they are reflected on the price chart. All of what you buy will be your conviction.

How do you build your conviction and distinguish between fraud and real businesses/assets? The engineering way is you stay close to your profession, stay close to what you use. As a user, you have a very good sense of whether the product you use will make a good business. For example, if you use the internet daily, and find yourself using it increasingly as AI emerges, it is a very good idea to make a bet on internet companies. The key here is if you can make sense of your judgement and other people (especially the press) don't really see the same thing, that's a good sign.

You don't have to limit this to just the stock market, anything you believe is underpriced, you should trust your instinct more. If you can spend a little but more money on your dates, you definitely should. If you can spend a little bit more money on those running shoes to help you run faster and more motivated, you should. The idea is to not think too much about money making, think about value generating. Funnily enough, investing as an engineer to a certain degree needs not to be greedy.
