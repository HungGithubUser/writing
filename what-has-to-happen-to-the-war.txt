[What has to happen to the Ukraine–Russia war]

I am somewhat hesitant to write this down, as it will be tough.

But assassination seems to be the only way out at this point — to Putin.

That's the only way out because he resists peace. Deep down he doesn't want peace, he wants war. Regardless of how you look at it, he wants war.

So he is a maniac, and the only way to deal with a maniac with nuclear power is to lay him down.

What happens after his assassination, I don't know; I have no idea about his ideals spreading. But it is pretty safe to say that the rest of Russia is not that crazy. Most people want peace, love, and technological advances. So the next Russian leader will change the situation.

But it seems to be a very long time until we can sort that out. World leaders want to talk. This is the problem: sometimes we shouldn't talk much; sometimes we should act — ruthlessly.

And this is one of those times — a time of action. Action speaks volumes, power and results matter.

Well... I don't have that power. All I can do is suggest and pray.

So... I wish the world the best of luck.
