[What has to happen to the Ukraine and Russian war]

I am somewhat hesitate to write this down. As it will be tough.

But assassination seems to be the only way out at this point. To Putin.

That's the only way out because. He resists piece. Deep down he doesn't want piece, he wants war. Regardless of how you look at it, he wants war.

So he is a maniac, and the only way to solve a maniac with nuclear power is to lay him down.

What happen after his assassination, I don't know, I have no idea about his idealism spread. But it is pretty safe to say that the rest of Russian is not that crazy. Most people want piece and love and technological advances. So the next Russian leader will change the situation.

But it seems to be a very long time until we can sort that out. World leaders want to talk. This is the problem, sometimes we shouldn't talk much, sometimes we should act, ruthlessly.

And this is one of those time, time of action. Action speaks volume, power, and result matters.

Well... I don't have that power, all I can do is suggest, and pray.

So... wish the world the best of luck.
