[Human taste in the AI era]

I have been questioned by someone curious to write about human taste in the AI era. This question is better learned by building than writing, but I think it would still be helpful writing out some building principles to get the goodness of human taste when it comes.

- Simplification:

This phenomenon becomes more apparent when AI standardizes the solution for existing problems. Every published golden standard get indexed, and answered when asked. But AI doesn't combine adjacent problems, not when it is tasked to solve problems. So we now need to do the combination and connect the dots ourselves. When adjacent problems are solved, the next step is to transcend: solve bigger problem by carefully combine and select the solutions. Like a step up in the ever increasing size of problem solved.

So now we can have a new goal to aim for: To be more productive in the age of AI, we can try to simplify the definition of our goal as much as we can. We used to work in a divide and concur manner. But as AI becoming more capable, it is beneficial to consider the reverse: transcend by connecting the dots and simplify the goal definition.

Usually we divide and concur to solve preset problem. But simplify and connect comes subconsciously and does not happen much in restrained settings, it happens when we try to push the boundary of excellence. The solution may come so surprising that people would be in doubts. This is where human has to be brave in the genre of AI. We need to say things that AI is not expected to say, or ask AI questions we aren't expected to ask to win bigger prizes. Is it possible? Perhaps. Is it necessary? Absolutely.
