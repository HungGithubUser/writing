[Human taste in the AI era]

I have been questioned by a curious girl about human taste as an edge in the AI era. This question is better learned by building than writing, but I think it is still helpful writing out some building principles to get the goodness of human taste when it comes. Then maybe I'll try to tackle the definition of "human taste" that is most useful.

1. Embrace technology: This goes without saying, not just AI but all the other technologies. Use them with passion and use them with care, give AI and you time to co-adopt. But be ruthless in cutting technologies that slow you down or take your important time away.

2. Simplify what you want get done, then do it. Simplification has 2 advantages: Clear and precise context gives AI the best understanding to work. And clarity of thoughts allow you understand what should be done so you know the expected outcome. If the problem is too big for a simple solution, break it down.

3. Occasionally think about where you're going and what the science is telling you when working. Science guides you like a river flow into the ocean, don't resist, embrace.

4. Be consciously fanatic about excellence, and let your brain work on the subconscious magic. This helps you connect the dots and group results to solve a bigger undefined problems.

5. Care about people: Human has an edge over AI at caring what other human thinks. Embrace this, keep racking your head to please your user and feel what will a human feel. Be a proxy for your user and use your product relentlessly.

6. Wiggle the problem space if you can, most people keep on hammering the solution space, this is especially apparent in corporate environment. Sometimes a little shift in the problem space is what needed for a significant gain of excellence.

7. Have deep conversations with your users, not A/B testings. Paul Graham was right about do things that don't scale, the most striking thing about that is the conversation you have with your users. Or yourself becomes your own user, learn to love your product and be critical with it for the better. Try to see if you remember the name of your users.

8. Vision in decades, then work in hours. Bias towards action, work with less information than you'd want and less certainty than you have. Move incrementally and bravely in darkness, keep caring for your users, that's your Northern star.

9. Embrace stupid sounding idea, especially when it comes from sensible people. An idea is like a new born baby, don't compare it to the standardized eagle in the sky. And stupid sounding idea coming from domain experts is valuable either wrong or right, if it's wrong, you'd probably make the same mistake, if it's right, it's a legend waiting to grow.

10. Think without much filters, don't care too much about nei sayer, listen to everyone, then make your own decision.

11. Trust the future, the technology, besides, what kind of builder who wouldn't trust the future, he/she is implementing the future.

12. Work hard, harder than what most people feels comfortable. But don't work blindly, on every moment work on the most promising thing, keep wining, keep the momentum of work. This is fulfilling and no regret

13. Don't be afraid to work on stupid looking things if you know why, keep working. The most valuable insights happens when you work on manual unknown tasks, and you wouldn't know it's a valuable insight until much later.

14. Don't make excuses, everyone has flaws, the winners embrace their flaws and work to their strength. "I can do it, let me take care of this, don't worry".

15. It's good to be scrappy. Suites and ties are not for builders, real work gets done when your feet is off the floor in your towel.

Human taste in the age of era: a combination of hard work, passion, empathy and embracing technology to serve humankind from human builders
