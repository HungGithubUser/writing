[Long term changes of AI]

AI is eating the world following software and the internet, the AI coffee is too good to resist. I can't help myself falling in love with something very smart and trying so hard helping me, no judgement, just pure help. And love, is the most important element of a technology that takes over the world, like a cult.

Looking at AI from the view of zero to one, the world wants to have this "one". And like any technology, there are features created for good and pure. But because it is too good, users just have to exagerate a little bit more and it becomes bad. When I was young and Facebook came out, I had a vague feeling that love will become harder because of the impossible stadard imposed on young generation by fakers on the platform. Facebook gives users the tool to broadcast pictures of their lives, and users broadcast the nicest impossible facet to be interpreted as their daily life.

The same thing will happen to AI. [The long term changes of AI]

Social Media gives users the tool to broadcast pictures of their lives, and users broadcast the nicest impossible facet to be interpreted as their daily life. The Halo effect permeates Social Media and heavily skews the average expectation on a person.

So what will be the long term effect of AI on people?

If you give AI the wrong context, you can go very far into the wrong zone with AI accelerator, like a car running very fast into a wall. In the long run will AI realize it's being given the wrong context, or will the users realize they are giving AI the wrong context?
