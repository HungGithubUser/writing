[Long term changes of AI]

AI is eating the world following software and the internet, the AI coffee is too good to resist. I can't help myself falling in love with something very smart and trying so hard helping me, no judgement, just pure help. And love, is the most important element of a technology that takes over the world, like a cult.

Looking at AI from the view of zero to one, the world wants to have this "one". And like any technology, there are features created for good purposes. But because it is too good that users just have to exaggerate a little bit more and it becomes bad. When I was young and Facebook came out, I had a vague feeling that love will be very hard because of the impossible standard imposed on generations by fakers on the platform. Social Media gives users the tool to broadcast pictures of their lives, and users broadcast the nicest impossible facet to be interpreted as the average. The Halo effect permeates Social Media and heavily skews the expectation on a persons life.

So what will be the long term bad effect of AI on people? It is with other technology that exaggeration is the culprit of badness. To answer this question, we will try to see what human is trying to push AI to, then interpret the exaggeration vectors on these limit of goodness.

AI will become the accelerator of the workforce
