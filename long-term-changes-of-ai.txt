[Long term changes of AI]

AI is eating the world following software and the internet, the AI coffee is too good to resist. I can't help myself falling in love with something very smart and trying so hard helping me, no judgement, just pure help. And love, is the most important element of a technology that takes over the world, like a cult.

Looking at AI from the view of zero to one, the world wants to have this "one". And like any technology, there are features created for good purposes. But because it is too good that users just have to exaggerate a little bit more and it becomes bad. When I was young and Facebook came out, I had a vague feeling that love will be very hard because of the impossible standard imposed on generations by fakers on the platform. Social Media gives users the tool to broadcast pictures of their lives, and users broadcast the nicest impossible facet to be interpreted as the average. The Halo effect permeates Social Media and heavily skews the expectation on a persons life.

So what will be the long term effect of AI on people? It is the same with other technology that exaggeration is the culprit of badness. To answer this question, we will try to see what human will push AI to be, then interpret the exaggeration vectors on these limits. Then try to see whether it is possible to create the boundary of where the edge of goodness are, or goodness becomes a paradox and we have to endure the badness to get the goodness. It is in these paradoxical situations that I believe the long term bad effect of AI lies.

AI will become the accelerator of the workforce. AI is very good at doing tasks, finishing in the requirement when the expectation can be described in plain word/image/audio. In this situation, the measurement of goodness is speed multiplied by quality of execution. Speed is measurable in unit of time, and quality is measurable to the extend of the prompt at measuring them. The speed boundary is not paradoxical: the faster, the better. The quality of execution is not either: Knowing what the user want is the responsibility of the user, so is creating a good prompt. AI developers can just push AI boundary of speed and adherence to prompts.
