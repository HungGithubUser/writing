[Long term changes of AI]

AI is eating the world following software and the internet, the AI coffee is too good to resist. I can't help myself falling in love with something very smart and trying so hard helping me, no judgement, just pure help.

It is in these paradoxical situations that I believe the long term bad effect of AI lies.

AI will become the accelerator of the workforce. AI is very good at doing tasks, fill in the detail gaps when the expectation is clear enough and can be described in plain English. In this situation, the boundary of goodness is
